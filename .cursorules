## Import Organization
- All import statements MUST be placed at the top of the file
- Follow PEP 8 import order: standard library -> third-party -> local modules
- Each import statement should be on a separate line
- Never place import statements inside functions or methods
- Use absolute imports, not relative imports
- Separate groups with blank lines
- Sort imports alphabetically within each group

## Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 strictly
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Comments and logs should be in English
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Two blank lines between top-level functions and classes
- One blank line between methods inside a class

## File Organization
- Each file should only contain one main functionality
- Related functionality should be in the same module
- Avoid circular imports

## Testing
