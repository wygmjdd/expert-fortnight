# Python Code Style Rules

## Import Organization

- All import statements MUST be placed at the top of the file
- Follow PEP 8 import order: standard library -> third-party -> local modules
- Each import statement should be on a separate line
- Never place import statements inside functions or methods
- Use absolute imports, not relative imports
- Separate groups with blank lines
- Sort imports alphabetically within each group

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 strictly
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Comments and logs should be in English
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Two blank lines between top-level functions and classes
- One blank line between methods inside a class
- Overall code style should follow principles from "Clean Code" (《代码整洁之道》 by Robert C. Martin)

## Comments

- Comments are a last resort - code should be self-explanatory through clear naming and structure
- Use comments only when code cannot express intent, to explain "why" rather than "what", or when legally required
- Avoid redundant, outdated, or misleading comments
- Good code itself is more important than extensive comments - replace comments with clear code and naming
- Do not add comments explaining why code was modified before or after changes - such comments become outdated in later iterations and cause confusion

## File Organization

- Each file should only contain one main functionality
- Related functionality should be in the same module
- Avoid circular imports
- `__init__.py` files can be created for modules, but do not re-export (forward) imports in `__init__.py` files - it's unnecessary

## Testing

- Python version: Python 3
- Tests must be run in a virtual environment

## Other Rules

- Do not create documentation files unless explicitly requested
